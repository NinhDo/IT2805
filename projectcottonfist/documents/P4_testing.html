        <p class="subjectInfo">
            We simply asked our test subjects to browse our website on their own accord and then fill out our Google
            Form survey. The survey queried the test subject on a couple of questions in which they answered either
            using a slide from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 (strongly disagree to strongly agree), or replying with a small
            paragraph. <br><br>
            The questions are mostly about the aesthetics of the website, with some questions about how easy it was to
            use, or what errors or difficulties they encountered.<br><br>
            The final questions ask about their professions and which browser they used to browse the website with. As
            we decided not to focus on different platforms such as tablets or phones due to time constraints, we asked
            the subjects to only browse the website using either a laptop or a desktop PC.<br><br>

        <p class="subjectInfo">
            After feeling that the website was completed, we created the survey to acquire feedback from a range of
            different people. The survey was sent to acquaintances whom we know to like the puppet industry. In
            addition, we sent the survey to some fellow students to get their academic views.
            <br><br>
            From our survey, which 13 people kindly replied to, 30.8% where unspecified students, 23.1% where
            unspecified private sector employees, 30.8% had art related occupations, 7.7% where unemployed, and 7.7%
            worked in an unspecified official sector.
            <br><br>
            We where quite happy with the results of the survey as we did not expect to have over 30% of the subjects to
            have art related professions, though it is worth to mention hat 30.8% of 13 people is only 4 people.

            Name: Mads<br>
            Age: 25<br>
            Occupation: Student (Computer Science)<br>
            OS: Windows 10<br>
            Browser: Chrome<br><br>

            <strong>Instructions given:</strong><br>
            Go to given address, browse a little. tell me what works and what doesn't<br><br>

            <strong>Observations:</strong><br>

            At first when he arrived to splash screen, his initial response to it was to navigate with the arrows on the
            keyboard, this didn’t work. Second attempt was scrolling the mousewheel and we got into the main page.
            Instead of initially using the nav bar he looked into the main page content to check what this is about, he
            instantly located browse bar and went to see the stock. Since this user is not super familiar with the
            different types of puppets he didn’t identify the puppet types by their types until his mouse hovered over
            Puppet Info nav-button where he could easily see the types of puppets we had without leaving the page. He
            clicked to the puppet info page using the drop down buttons to see more about that specific type of puppet,
            and clicked to see our stock of that type. He then proceeded to navigate back and forth to see about the
            different types. After about 2 more minutes of browsing we asked him a couple of questions.<br><br>

            <strong>Questions:</strong><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the purpose of this website?</li>
            <li>Did you find it quick and easy to navigate?</li>
            <li>How did you find the style/look of the website?</li>
            <li>What was the feature you liked the most?</li>
            <li>What was the feature you liked the least?</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Summary of answers:</strong><br>
            He could identify that it was about puppets but not by the splash screen but by the main page.
            Navigation was intuitive and quick, nothing were more that 2 clicks away.
            The style was clean and professional, but with the pastel colors it added a hint of playfulness.
            He liked the ability to instantly find what kind of puppets we had of that type after he had read about
            them. He didn’t like that he didn’t have any opportunity to contact us, either through phone or e-mail.

        <p class="subjectInfo">
            The majority of the questions was about the site aesthetics, as mentioned above (see 2. Testing Document).
            The responses where mostly positive, with 46.2% giving a 5 (strongly agree) and 38.5% giving a 4 on the
            pages attractiveness. 84.6% gave a 5 and the remaining 15.4% gave a 4 when asked if the site site had a
            clean and simple presentation or not. 69.2% strongly agreed that the site was easy to use, and 76.9% said
            that they were able to quickly find what they needed on the website. The final score-based question was
            about giving the site a rating from 1 to 10 (terrible to excellent), where 46.2% gave a 10/10, and only 7.7&
            gave it a score below 5.
