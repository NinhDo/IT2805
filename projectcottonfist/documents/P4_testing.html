        <p class="subjectInfo">
            We simply asked our test subjects to browse our website on their own accord and then fill out our Google
            Form survey. The survey queried the test subject on a couple of questions in which they answered either
            using a slide from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 (strongly disagree to strongly agree), or replying with a small
            paragraph. <br><br>
            The questions are mostly about the aesthetics of the website, with some questions about how easy it was to
            use, or what errors or difficulties they encountered.<br><br>
            The final questions ask about their professions and which browser they used to browse the website with. As
            we decided not to focus on different platforms such as tablets or phones due to time constraints, we asked
            the subjects to only browse the website using either a laptop or a desktop PC.<br><br>

        <p class="subjectInfo">
            After feeling that the website was completed, we created the survey to acquire feedback from a range of
            different people. The survey was sent to acquaintances whom we know to like the puppet industry. In
            addition, we sent the survey to some fellow students to get their academic views.
            <br><br>
            From our survey, which 13 people kindly replied to, 30.8% where unspecified students, 23.1% where
            unspecified private sector employees, 30.8% had art related occupations, 7.7% where unemployed, and 7.7%
            worked in an unspecified official sector.
            <br><br>
            We where quite happy with the results of the survey as we did not expect to have over 30% of the subjects to
            have art related professions, though it is worth to mention hat 30.8% of 13 people is only 4 people.

            Name: Mads<br>
            Age: 25<br>
            Occupation: Student (Computer Science)<br>
            OS: Windows 10<br>
            Browser: Chrome<br><br>

            <strong>Instructions given:</strong><br>
            Go to given address, browse a little. tell me what works and what doesn't<br><br>

            <strong>Observations:</strong><br>

            At first when he arrived to splash screen, his initial response to it was to navigate with the arrows on the
            keyboard, this didn’t work. Second attempt was scrolling the mousewheel and we got into the main page.
            Instead of initially using the nav bar he looked into the main page content to check what this is about, he
            instantly located browse bar and went to see the stock. Since this user is not super familiar with the
            different types of puppets he didn’t identify the puppet types by their types until his mouse hovered over
            Puppet Info nav-button where he could easily see the types of puppets we had without leaving the page. He
            clicked to the puppet info page using the drop down buttons to see more about that specific type of puppet,
            and clicked to see our stock of that type. He then proceeded to navigate back and forth to see about the
            different types. After about 2 more minutes of browsing we asked him a couple of questions.<br><br>

            <strong>Questions:</strong><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the purpose of this website?</li>
            <li>Did you find it quick and easy to navigate?</li>
            <li>How did you find the style/look of the website?</li>
            <li>What was the feature you liked the most?</li>
            <li>What was the feature you liked the least?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subjectInfo">
            <strong>Summary of answers:</strong><br>
            He could identify that it was about puppets but not by the splash screen but by the main page.
            Navigation was intuitive and quick, nothing were more that 2 clicks away.
            The style was clean and professional, but with the pastel colors it added a hint of playfulness.
            He liked the ability to instantly find what kind of puppets we had of that type after he had read about
            them. He didn’t like that he didn’t have any opportunity to contact us, either through phone or e-mail.

        <h3 class="subject">4. Testing Platform</h3>
        We asked the user explicitly to use either laptop or PC when testing this website since it’s not designed for
        Tablet or Mobile.

        From the survey we gathered these results.
        <img src="./images/browser.png" alt="Browsers tested pie chart">

        Main reason for asking the users to tell us what browser they used is to see what browsers has what bugs if any,
        and if there is a difference in user experience in using different browsers.
        Since there were no bugs submitted we are rather looking on the response from different browsers.
        We got above average response from the users of Chrome, Edge and Opera. Since both Chrome and Edge is two of the
        most used browsers we are happy that this is giving us a positive feedback on functionality and experience. On
        Firefox we got less than average, but this may not be accurate on average since we only had a small sample size
        of users using firefox.
        The worst feedback comes from Internet Explorer where dialup were used, this is expected since we haven't built
        this website to handle old browsers.

        <h3 class="subject">5. User Feedback</h3>

        <p class="subjectInfo">
            The majority of the questions was about the site aesthetics, as mentioned above (see 2. Testing Document).
            The responses where mostly positive, with 46.2% giving a 5 (strongly agree) and 38.5% giving a 4 on the
            pages attractiveness. 84.6% gave a 5 and the remaining 15.4% gave a 4 when asked if the site site had a
            clean and simple presentation or not. 69.2% strongly agreed that the site was easy to use, and 76.9% said
            that they were able to quickly find what they needed on the website. The final score-based question was
            about giving the site a rating from 1 to 10 (terrible to excellent), where 46.2% gave a 10/10, and only 7.7%
            gave it a score below 5.

        <p class="subjectInfo">
            We also asked the subject, if they wanted, to write something about what they liked about the website. One
            seubject gave a positive response to the color scheme that we chose, which pleased Mr. Cottonfist quite a
            lot. Another subject said that he or she quite liked the simplisity of the site, and another one said that
            he or she quite liked that the puppets stayed expanded when you clicked on them, and it was quite easy due
            to that to navigate back to it.<br><br>
            The last important question we asked was if the subject experienced any bugs during his or her test. Luckily
            we received no reports of any bugs, however, one user kindly responded with a request to allow the subject
            to access the front page without the need of scrolling with the mouse wheel, and rather click on the arrow
            or use the arrow keys.

    <div id="feedback response">
        <h3 class="subject">6. Response to the feedback</h3>
        We where quite happy with the overwhelming positive response. The request to click on the arrow on the splash
        screen to go into the front page was quickly implemented, and in hindsight was simply overlooked by us. We were
        hesitant to add the down arrow key as a way to start the splash screen transition, however after the live
        testing, we found out that a subject using a laptop is more likely to use the arrow keys to scroll rather than
        the trackpad or mouse wheel on an external mouse. Therefore we chose to add the option to start the transition
        using the down arrow.

        <h3 class="subject">7. Self Reflection</h3>
        Because we knew that finding a reliable client would be a big task, we decided very early on to work with one we
        made up on our own. We had a lot of fun not only making up the story of Dropphase and Gunnar Cottonfist but also
        the design and features of our website. While not having a client might have spared us some time, it also made
        it so we had to decide what we wanted by acting as clients ourselves. This made it difficult in different ways
        due to us having the job of deciding what content and design was needed for each page. As we went on with our
        website we ended up having two of our initial team drop out for various reasons, leaving us with a larger
        workload. Luckily we had sufficient experience with making websites and could work very closely together. Due to
        the smaller team each of us had more responsibility, but it also meant that we were forced to work efficiently.
        As the least experienced in the team I learned more than I expected to learn, mostly due to my own mistakes that
        were quickly corrected by the team. Due to none of us being experts on the art of puppeteering we had to do some
        thorough research on it. Without the help of both Wikipedia and the website of Peter Noer (<a
            href="http://chimeronuniverse.freeservers.com/">http://chimeronuniverse.freeservers.com/</a>) as sources we
        would be troubled to find the necessary information about puppets.
