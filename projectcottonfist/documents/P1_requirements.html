		<h3 class="subject">Purpose and goals</h3>
		<p class="subjectInfo">
		Mr. Cottonfist has achieved great success in his telephone services, but feels the growth has stagnated in recent years. Therefore, he wishes to expand to an internet service and take advantage of technological progress in order to make his business grow internationally.
<br/>Specifically, the goals he wants finished in the duration of this project is to have sections of puppets divided on how they function (sock puppets, hand puppets, animatronics, etc.), an about section where the clients may learn more about Mr. Cottonfist and his credibility, and an FAQ, where general questions regarding the company and/or details about the dolls.
<br/>The last goal he wants is to implement an ordering system, however in this project he only wants the visuals, and therefore not anything with the back-end yet.
