        Hand Puppet
        <div class="hidden">
            There are many variations to a hand puppet. If the puppet does not have a movable mouth, three fingers on
            one hand become the neck and two arms. This type of puppet is often called a glove puppet. If the puppet has
            a movable mouth, traditionally the thumb serves as the lower jaw; the four fingers form the upper mouth.

            Sticks or wire rod manipulate rod puppets attached to the neck and hands. In most cases, these controls come
            from below. Rod puppets may also be worked with rods from above, or any direction necessary for good
            movement and performance.

        Shadow Puppet
        <div class="hidden">
            Mostly rod puppets, they are made flat and cast a shadow when the puppeteer manipulates them between a light
            source and a screen (often a piece of muslin stretched like a canvas). A shadow puppeteer learns to move the
            puppet in and out of the light so its shadow grows and shrinks and goes in and out of sharp focus.
            Traditionally, these are made from animal hides that are painted and punched with decorative designs.
            Colored acetates are often used to create colors in the puppet's projected shadow.

        Marionette
        <div class="hidden">
            One of the most difficult forms of puppetry to manipulate effectively, marionettes hang on strings. Usually
            there are eight basic strings to a well-designed marionette. However, some marionettes can have thirty or
            more. A good marionette performer learns how to use gravity to give the puppet life and weight. To work a
            marionette well, one must practice.

        Ventriloquist Figure
        <div class="hidden">
            Just don't call it a dummy. Only Paul Winchell may do that. He's one of the great ventriloquists in show
            business. Ventriloquism is lots of fun, but it too takes a great deal of practice. The puppet has a slotted
            mouth that works on a trigger. A good vent figure will also have multiple eye movement and eyebrows. Shari
            Lewis, Edgar Bergen, Jimmy Nelson were all well known and loved -famous Ventriloquists.

        Animatronic
        <div class="hidden">
            Animatronics refers to the use of robotic devices to emulate a human or an animal, or bring lifelike
            characteristics to an otherwise inanimate object. Animatronic creations include animals, plants and even
            mythical creatures. Modern animatronics have found widespread applications in movie special effects and
            theme parks and have, since their inception, been primarily used as a spectacle of amusement. Animatronics
            is a multi-disciplinary field which integrates anatomy, robots, mechatronics, and puppetry resulting in
            lifelike animation. Animatronic figures are often powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, or by electrical means,
            and can be implemented using both computer control and human control, including teleoperation. Motion
            actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs.
